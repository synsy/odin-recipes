    <p>Here is the recipe for the perfect filet mignon:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Filet Mignons</li>
        <li>salt & ground black pepper to taste (season generously!)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic peeled</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Remove fillet steaks from fridge 30-60 minutes before preparing. Unwrap, season and let sit on a plate on the counter. For best results, do not skip this step.</li>
        <li><strong>Sear:</strong> Once ready to cook, heat oven to 360°F. Place a medium cast iron skillet over high heat for 3-5 minutes. Once hot, carefully add oil (watch out for splatters). Sear the Filet Mignon for 2-3 minutes per side (1-2 minutes for Petite Filet Mignons), until browned with a nice crust. Immediately remove skillet from heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish:</strong> Carefully add butter, garlic and rosemary to skillet. Place skillet in oven and bake for 2-8 minutes, depending on preferred doneness (see notes for internal temperatures; remove skillet from oven once internal temperature is 5-10°F below desired temperature).
            As a rule of thumb, 5 minutes will yield fillet steaks cooked to about medium. 3-4 minutes will yield medium-rare fillet steaks. 2 minutes will yield rare fillet steaks. 6-7 minutes will yield medium-well and 8 minutes well-done fillet steaks. The exact timing depends on your exact Filet Mignon weight and thickness.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Remove steak from skillet and place on a plate. Tent with foil, then rest for 5-10 minutes (do not skip rest). Serve with garlic cloves and butter from skillet.</li>
    </ol>
